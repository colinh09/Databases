Question 3 Write Up

To expand the code base and aid the boat rental buisiness, I decided to add
an inventory repair tracker, which keeps track of which boat's repair history. If a boat is need or is scheduled to get a repair, an employee will get assigned to the boat. This will allow the buisness to keep track if employees are doing their job of repairing boats properly and on a timely manner. The cost of the repair will also be tracked for the buisiness' finances. 

To do this, I added two new tables

The first table is called repairs. Repairs will have five columns: the repair id, the boat id, the employee id, the cost of the repair, when the repair is scheduled, and whether the repair was made.


The second table is called employees. This table is simple with only three columns: the employee id, the boat id, and the repair id. This way, the buisness will be able to identify both if an employee has repaired a specific boat or how many boats has the employee repaired. 


To add on to the two new tables, I needed to add two new columns to boats, which include an employee id column and its repair id.
